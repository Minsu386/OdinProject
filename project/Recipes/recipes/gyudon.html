        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A popular fast-food dish in Japan. Gyudon is a quick-simmered mixure of thinly sliced
            beef and crisp-tender onions cooked in a sweet soy broth that is seasoned with fresh ginger (optional).
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb boneless beef rib-eye</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons instant dashi</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Sake</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons mirin</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, halved, then thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>Cooked Rice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cut beef crosswise into 2 pieces, then set your beef in the freezer for at least 1 hour to
                 freeze until firm. Once the beef is very firm, slice it very thinly against the grain,
                 ideally about ⅛-inch thick. Set aside at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Bring 1¼ cups water to a boil in a large skillet. Whisk in instant dashi until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the soy sauce, sake, mirin and sugar, stir to combine, and boil over high until flavors
                 meld and mixture starts to reduce, about 8 minutes. Add the sliced onion and cook over
                 medium until onion just starts to soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the beef and cook, turning the sliced beef frequently using tongs, until beef is 
                 just barely cooked and loses any traces of pink, about 3 minutes. Stir in the fresh ginger
                 and cook for 1 more minute.</li>
            <li>Divide rice among bowls and top with beef mixture and any juices. Serve with pickled ginger
                and sprinkle with togarashi, if desired.</li>
        </ul>
